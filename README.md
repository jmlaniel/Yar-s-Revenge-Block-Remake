# Yar's Revenge Block Remake

This project consists in a remake of the Atari 2600 game "Yar'S Revenge" where everything are blocks

Tested with Pygame 2.0.0dev12 and Python 3.7.3

This project is the result of an homework given by OldSkoolCoder (https://oldskoolcoder.co.uk)
Many Thanks to John for all his streaming and help coding Pygame/Python and 6502 stuff for the C64.
Shoutout also to the community on the Discord server.

## Instructions

Play the game with the arrows on the keyboard and the space for firing the missile of bullets.

It is best of you watch the original game to fully understand its mechanics.

This is a work in progress.

# How to build

'main.py' can be run directly if you have Pygame installed.

# TODO

- Write an end sequence when the player win or die
- Write an intro to the game
